/**
 * A continuous rotation servo is a servo that can turn around and around like a motor but does not
 * have any position feedback like a normal servo does.
 * This class turns a continous rotation servo into a motor that can move a distance. It is not
 * completely accurate but it gets pretty close. It is done by characterizing a servo to see how
 * far it moves in a given time in both the forwards and backwards directions. Once the rate is
 * known, then a time to run the servo can be calculated given the desired distance to move. The
 * assumption here is that the load on the servo does not change. Note that testing showed that the
 * cm/Sec is different forwards and backwards.
 * In theory, if you give a CR servo a command of 0.5 (1/2 way between 0 and 1) it will not move.
 * But testing showed that 0.5 produced movement. So there are 2 values that need to be found for
 * each servo. The values are the ones that produce no movement in the forwards and backwards
 * direction. Testing found them to be different. Note that forwards and backwards are defined by
 * the direction that the servo is setup for.
 * Position command for a CRServo is really the speed (throttle) command.
 * 0 is full power backward.
 * somewhere around 0.5 is stop
 * +1 is full power forward
 * This setup is not intuitive. I think this is more intuitive:
 * -1 is full power backward
 * 0 is stop
 * +1 is full power forward
 * So I am choosing to make the input range -1 to +1.
