/**
 * This opmode is used to calibrate a servo so you can find the positions that the servo should 
 * be set to when it is actually running on the real robot. You setup a start position and end 
 * position. The servo will step from the start position to the end position in an increment you
 * pick. You can also tell the servo how long to spend at each position. For example, you need to
 * determine the position that a servo must be in to open a gate. You start it at position = 0.0
 * and end it at position = 1.0. The increment you pick is .05 and the time at each position is 1000
 * milli-seconds (1 second). The servo will start at position = 0, stay there for 1 second, then
 * move to position = .05 and stay there for one second, then move to position = .10 and stay there
 * for one second and so on until it reaches position = 1.0. While looking at the servo, you might 
 * see that position = .45 is where the gate opens. So you can now program your servo on the robot
 * to move to .45 when you want the gate to open.
 *
 * When you run this opmode, you are going to have to configure the robot controller phone with a
 * name for the servo you want to calibrate. That name will also have to be set in this code. See
 * below.
