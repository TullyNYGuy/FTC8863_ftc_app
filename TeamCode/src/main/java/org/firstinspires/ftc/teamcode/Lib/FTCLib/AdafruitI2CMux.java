/**
 * This class provides an interface to the Adafruit TCA9548A I2C 1 to 8 mux. The input I2C bus can
 * be connected to one or more of the 8 ports. Most often, this will be used if you have more than
 * one I2C device with the same address. Wire the devices to the pins on the board. Then use the mux
 * to switch between the devices and talk to only one of them at a time (see selectAndEnableAPort())
 * This mux is very simple since it has only one register. So it makes a good learning tool to understand
 * how to read and write an I2C device. The default address for the mux is 0x70.
 *
 * https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-tca9548a-1-to-8-i2c-multiplexer-breakout/wiring-and-test?view=all
 *
 * You will need to configure your phone with a "I2C Device" on one of the I2C ports.
 * Give the device a name when you configure it on the phone. This will be the muxName you pass
 * into the constructor.
 *
 * WARNING: if you are using this mux to read multiple adafruit color sensors then be aware of a
 * possible issue. When you switch from one color sensor on one port to another color sensor on
 * another port, there will be a period of time needed before the data will be valid for the new
 * sensor. This is because it takes time to get data from the new color sensor and populate the
 * data in the data cache. Reports on the FTC forum indicate that it takes from 50 mSec to 150 mSec
 * to get valid data. If you read before then, you will likely get the data from the first color
 * sensor not the new one. In order to avoid this switch the mux port well before you need valid
 * data or put a delay in your code after switching mux ports and before reading color values.
