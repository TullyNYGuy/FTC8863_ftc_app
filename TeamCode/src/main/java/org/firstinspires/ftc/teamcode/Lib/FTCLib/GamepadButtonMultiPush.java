/**
 * This class sets up a way of assigning a set of commands to one button. Each press of the button
 * will advance to the next command in the cycle. When the last command in the cycle is run, the
 * cycle starts over again. The class currently handles 4 commands tied to one button.
 *
 * Example use:
 *
 * For a normal situation where just one command executes when a game pad button is pushed:
 * declaration
 * public GamepadButtonMultiPush gamepad1x;
 *
 * initialization
 * gamepad1x = new GamepadButtonMultiPush(1)
 *
 * use
 *  if (gamepad1x.buttonPress(gamepad1.x)) {
 *       //this was a new button press, not a button held down for a while
 *       the command goes on this line;
 *  }
 *
 *  For a button that has mulitple commands tied to it
 *
 *  declaration
 * GamepadButtonMultiPush gamepad1x;
 *
 * initialization
 * gamepad1x = new GamepadButtonMultiPush(4);
 *
 * use
 * if (gamepad1x.buttonPress(gamepad1.x)) {
 *     if (gamepad1x.isCommand1()) {
 *         // call the first command you want to run
 *     }
 *     if (gamepad1x.isCommand2()) {
 *         // call the 2nd command you want to run
 *     }
 *     if (gamepad1x.isCommand3()) {
 *         // call the 3rd command you want to run
 *     }
 *     if (gamepad1x.isCommand4()) {
 *         // call the 4th command you want to run
 *     }
 * }
